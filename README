Computes estimates for the Knapsack Problem using a Genetic Algorithm.

Notes:
 - Run using "clisp ga_knapsack.lisp". I recommend a large terminal to see
 pretty-display for the output.

 - Tweaking parameters for *num-generations*, *mutation-rate*, *ks-size*,
   *ks-pop-size*, *ks-overstuff-penalty* should drastically change the results
   of the program. I found the current parameters to be fairly good.


Improvements:
 - Make global parameters into command line arguments. This would be really
   useful since tweaking all of these has such a big impact.

 - Create new knapsack item files, with different values to test with.

 - Parse a more human readable format for reading item files. Using a lisp
   file with item structs in it feels like cheating.

 - Create alternate solve- function for running until convergence in the
   population is detected.

 - Separate helper functions, genetic algorithm base, and knapsack problem
   into different modules. I don't understand the lisp module system very
   well.
