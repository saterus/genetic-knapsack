Notes:
 - Run using "clisp ga_knapsack.lisp". I recommend a large terminal
to see pretty-display for the output.

 - Tweaking parameters for *num-generations*, *ks-size*,
*ks-overstuff-penalty* should drastically change the results of the
program. I found the current parameters to be fairly good.


Improvements:
 - Make parameters into command line arguments.

 - Create new knapsack item files, with different values to test
with.

 - Parse a more human readable format for reading item files. Using
a lisp file with item structs in it feels like cheating.

 - Create alternate solve- function for running until convergence
in the population is detected.

 - Separate helper functions, genetic algorithm base, and knapsack
problem into different modules.
